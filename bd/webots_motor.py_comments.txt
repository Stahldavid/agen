This code block represents functions of a class responsible for controlling motors in Webots. The semantic search results indicate that the code could benefit from more error checking and logging for debug purposes, improved commenting to increase code understandability, and additional Webots functions that could be utilized. The getMaxForce function and getMaxTorque function might be useful to limit the inputs to the SetForce and SetTorque functions.
