This is a motor control script for Webots. It controls the robot's motors including the speed/direction as well as sensors connected for feedback such as force and positioning sensors. Motor class encapsulates all functionalities related to controlling the robot's motors using Webots simulation software. It defines various methods and properties mainly related to setting/getting the available force, torque, target position, velocity etc., and getting the feedback of force, torque, motor type etc. Some methods are defined for getting processed data like type, brake, position_sensor etc., The class features setters and getters for various motor attributes, and uses Webots's motor API to get the information from the simulator.
