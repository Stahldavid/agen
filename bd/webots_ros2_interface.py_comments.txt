The updated code integrates Webots and ROS2 functionality. It provides options for force feedback and torque feedback. In the updated main function, argument parsing is included to provide options for the node name. Details for joint prefix are included based on ROS parameters. Joint State Publisher and Trajectory Follower instances are created, allowing for update operations within the runtime loop. Simulation time usage for ROS is also accommodated by publishing Clock messages.
