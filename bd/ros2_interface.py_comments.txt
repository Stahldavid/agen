This code is the skeleton of a ROS2 interface for a variable impedance controller. It needs methods to handle ROS2 communication, including sending impedance commands to the controller and receiving force feedback data. According to the semantic search results, examples of similar projects can be found in the 'db_ros2_control' and 'db_ros2' directories. These examples should provide a good basis for implementing the unfinished methods in this class.
