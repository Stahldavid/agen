The provided code is the current version of the 'controller.py' file in a Python project. The project is aimed at developing a variable impedance control code for force feedback. Using the Controller class from the 'controller' module, the code creates a robot controller and then uses this controller to control a motor. The code uses the motor's 'setPosition' method to set the motor's position, which is updated every 50 time steps. The motor's torque feedback and the battery level are printed at each time step.
