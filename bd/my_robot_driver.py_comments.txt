I am working on a coding project that aims to develop a variable impedance control code for force feedback. I need your expertise to improve my code. Here is the current version of one file of my code, along with the semantic search queries Iâ€™ve done on a vectorstore using OpenAI embeddings, and the results of these queries:

Order of development: 1

my_robot_driver.py:
 
Code block type: file
 
Code block name: my_robot_driver.py
 
Code block description: File for controlling the robot's wheels.
