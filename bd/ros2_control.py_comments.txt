This is a basic structure of the ROS2 controller for variable impedance control. It includes methods to start and stop the control, set impedance parameters, and get force feedback. However, the methods are not implemented. They need to be improved using the insights from the semantic search query results, which can include references to libraries or packages, additional functionalities, or potential bugs to watch out for. The improved code should be fully functional and ready to run.
