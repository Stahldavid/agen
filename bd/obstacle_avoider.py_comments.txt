This is a ROS2 Node written in Python that uses sensor data published on 'left_sensor' and 'right_sensor' topics to avoid obstacles by publishing velocity commands calculated based on the sensor readings on 'cmd_vel' topic. This initial code simply avoids the obstacles by turning the vehicle when the reading from either left or right sensor goes below 90% of the MAX_RANGE. The 'main' function initializes the ROS2 system, creates an instance of the ObstacleAvoider node, keeps it running until terminated, destroys the node, and then shuts down the ROS2 system. No issues have been reported with this code, however, there might be other more effective or efficient ways to achieve the same functionalities or to structure the code.
