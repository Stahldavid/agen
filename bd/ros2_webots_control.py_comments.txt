The semantic search suggests the proper way to initialize nodes in ROS2 before implementing control systems, such as impedance control. Making sure the ROS2 environment is properly initialized alongside the bridge between ROS2 and Webots is also crucial. We should ensure that clean-up operations for when the node is shut down are included. The code should also be modified to use the appropriate ROS2 lifecycle for the controller nodes, such as active, inactive, and shutdown states.
