From the search results, it appears that the code is currently implemented correctly. However, the authors of similar code suggest that logging or error handling may be added to improve overall robustness and provide more informative feedback. Also, when working with command extensions in ROS2, it might be valuable to include help descriptions for arguments to improve usability. But specific additions would depend on the exact context of the project.
