This is a basic launch configuration for the ROS2 control system. It's not currently doing anything, it just imports the launch module. Based on the semantic search results, it looks like I need to add some code to configure the ROS2 control system. More specifically, the launch configuration may need to include the definition and setup of ROS2 nodes, especially those related to the 'robot_description', 'ros_control_params' and other configurations related to the variable impedance control system for force feedback.
