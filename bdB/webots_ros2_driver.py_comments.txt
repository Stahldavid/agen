Here we have a single python file that initializes the ROS node, launches the node and continuously spins till a time_out condition is set. Inside the spinning, motor velocities for left and right are calculated based on the angular speed and linear speed from Twist values received from the 'cmd_vel' topic. The class also has provision for creating instances and running overall control through 'run' method.
