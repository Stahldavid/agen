This is a Webots controller, the class signature and initial structure is provided. It's part of a robot control system that involves force feedback. The controller needs to be initialized and have a run method. However, its specific functionality still needs to be implemented. Semantic search results from OpenAI embeddings suggest a few code blocks that could be relevant for this implementation.
