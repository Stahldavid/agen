This is an initial version of a controller for a robot using webots and ROS2. Improvements can be made in terms of using the correct APIs to get devices and set up the robot controller. In the search results from the vectorstore, I've seen some relevant code examples in ros2_control, ros2, webots_ros2, and webots directories which might be useful for refining this code. For example, the usage of webots_ros2 APIs for getting devices by type could optimize the code. The existing code needs to be reviewed and improved based on those insights.
