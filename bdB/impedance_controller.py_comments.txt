The impedance controller is a critical component of this project. The primary purpose of the impedance controller is to regulate the interactive forces between the robot and its environment. Using the insights gained from semantic search queries, I have identified several ways to optimize and complete the current code. In the updated version of the code, I may use some machine-control libraries and classes from ROS2 and Webots.
