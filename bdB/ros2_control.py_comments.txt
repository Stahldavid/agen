The current code block already has a tidy structure where a Class VariableImpedanceControl is defined with methods to set impedance, damping, stiffness, and command. However, the implementation for these methods is missing, marked by TODOs. Moreover, the ros2_control example found from the semantic search can provide insights on how to implement these methods, particularly considering different control commands and associated hardware interface requirements. Insights from the example can help enhance the code defining the class and its various methods. I will complete these based on the context and optimization suggestions from the semantic search results.
