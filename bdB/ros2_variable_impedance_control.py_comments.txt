Semantic search queries on the vectorstore using OpenAI embeddings reveal some common patterns for ROS2 control code. Insights from these queries tell us that our code lacks the necessary publisher/subscriber setups, and the control logic is not defined. Control logic should include reading from sensors and actuating devices based on the control algorithm. The search results show that we may need to use PID controllers, include integral and proportional gains, and methods for clamping values to avoid overshoot. The Mavic driver example could be particularly helpful. The ROS2 documentation example provided new insights with the use of publishers and subscribers to orient the robot.
