This is a utility file for obtaining the left and right motor of a robotic system. It uses Webots and ROS's motor function. The semantic searches for utility functions in python returned detailed implementations of the utility files from several repositories including db_ros2_control, db_ros2, db_webots_ros2, and db_webots. The current utility file is too basic and can be made more efficient and comprehensive. The plan is to figure out a way to consolidate the codebase's utility needs into this utility file, following the structure and practice found in the semantic search results.
