Code refined based on semantic search results. Specifically, more explicit enabling of various features (like position and force feedback) of the motor device has been added. The motor torque has been set, and a battery Sensor enabled to track the battery level. Force feedback and battery level is being printed to make the results more verbose. The access to sensor values has been corrected to use the appropriate methods. In general, code clarity has been improved.
