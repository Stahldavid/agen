Improvements might be seen by adding some concrete behaviors into the methods of the interface such as __init__, start, stop, read, and write. The exact modifications would be dependent on the specific hardware being used. The results suggest the need for direct interaction with hardware via ros2cli and command related sub-commands. Additionally, there seems to be need for listing and managing hardware interfaces. Certain sensor interactions like position and velocity setting for wheel motors are indicated. "my_robot_driver.py" provides a good reference for how sensor data could be read or written to. The "obstacle_avoider.py" gives a hint for designing the feedback control where sensor readings affect the robot's motion commands.
