The updated code includes additional functionality for spawning a robot in a Webots environment in ROS2. This has been added as a method in the existing Control class. The method uses the WebotsLauncher to launch the Webots simulator with the provided world file and then launches a driver node for the robot with the provided robot description. The spawn_robot method further requires the directory of the package, the path to robot description file and the world file name for webots as input. All the inputs are configured to have default values.
