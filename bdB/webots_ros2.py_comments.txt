This code is written for Webots with ROS2. Suggestions from the semantic search results indicate that this code can be optimized by integrating functionalities like robot driver, TrajectoryFollower. Also, based on the result from 'db_webots_ros2', the usage of 'use_sim_time' parameter can be included which is not currently present in the code. It could be beneficial for aligning simulation time with ROS.
