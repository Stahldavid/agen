This file is a wrapper to connect ROS2 with the Webots simulation. The provided code integrates ROS2 and Webots and provides a framework for controlling the robot. I need to refine the control_robot method to include the actual control logic for the robot. It could use insights from semantic search results for ROS2 Webots wrapper, Webots and ROS2. The refined code should be applicable to my force feedback project using variable impedance control. The code should be efficient and effective with good readability.
