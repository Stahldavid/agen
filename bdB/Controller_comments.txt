The 'Controller' class currently has the '__init__' and 'run' methods, but they're empty. The 'Controller' class should contain methods to initialize the motor control and to run the motor control. In the semantics search results, we get to see some of the relevant usage examples of similar 'Controller' classes from different code sources (like 'ros2_control', 'ros2', 'webots_ros2', 'webots'). These examples show how the 'Controller' class could be potentially implemented and used in different scenarios. Let's use these insights to complete and enhance the 'Controller' class for the given application context that involves a variable impedance control code for force feedback.
