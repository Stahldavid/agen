The current code handles a single motor position control. The target position of the motor is increased every 50 iterations of a loop by pi/4. Each iteration, the robot also prints out the current torque feedback of the motor and the battery level to the console. However, the robot doesn't take any actions based on these values. Looking at the search results, there are several areas of the code that could potentially be improved. The ROS2 related search results suggest the use of ros2cli for controller management. However, the provided code isn't using ROS2, so these parts are likely not applicable. The Webots related search results include some examples of controlling multiple motors and using a linear motor to move in three-dimensional space. Depending on the motor setup on the actual robot, some of these concepts could potentially be useful.
