This is a basic implementation of ROS2 Node for controlling a robot based on force feedback. The read_force_sensor function and control_robot function need to be completed based on the specific robot and force sensor setup. Also, it could be beneficial to utilize the controller_manager to interface with different types of controllers, which can create a more flexible and robust control system.
