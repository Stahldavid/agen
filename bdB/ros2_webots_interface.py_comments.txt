This is the initial code file for the ROS2-Webots interface. It looks like it is intended to provide a single entry point for services or modules that require a node to interface with the ROS2 system. The Ros2WebotsInterface class initializes a node and the main function creates an instance of this class and calls its run method. The run method spins the node, keeping it running so that it can continue to process callbacks until it is shut down.
