The current program simulates a motor controller in Python that uses the Webots simulator. It seems the main goal of the script is to set a target position for a motor, increment this target position every 50 steps (time units), and display the current torque feedback and battery level for the system. Based on the semantic search queries, it's apparent that this code might benefit from better structure and encapsulation of methods, which is a common finding in ROS-based codes, such as switching between controllers, error handling, and controller activation/deactivation
