The given python code file, webots_ros2_interface.py, is used to create a Webots ROS2 Interface. This interface uses `rclpy` library to create a publisher for `JointState` messages on the `joint_states` topic. In the `update_joint_states` method, a new `JointState` object is created and published. However, the `JointState` variables are not populated with values from Webots. Semantic search results from OpenAI has returned multiple results from ros2_control, ros2_documentation and Webots libraries. The search result from webots_ros2_tiago/launch/robot_launch.py highlights the creation of a Node using parameters like robot_description and ros2_control_params, which could facilitate the goal of getting joint states from Webots environment. Additional semantic cues can be extracted from other search results.
